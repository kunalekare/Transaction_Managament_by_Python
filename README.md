# Transaction_Management_by_Python  
**Concepts Used:** Decorators, Generators, File Handling, Logging, CSV Processing  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Transaction Management System implemented in Python**.  
It demonstrates how **real-world transaction processing** can be handled using:

- **Decorators** → for logging and access control  
- **Generators** → for efficient transaction data processing  
- **CSV Files** → as a lightweight database  
- **Logging Module** → for maintaining system logs  
- **Pytest** → for system testing  

The project reads transactions from CSV files, processes them efficiently, logs system activities, and validates functionality using test cases.

## 🧠 Theory

### 1️⃣ Decorators in Python
A **decorator** is a function that modifies the behavior of another function **without changing its source code**.

#### Why Decorators?
- Add logging
- Track execution
- Enforce validation
- Improve code reusability
